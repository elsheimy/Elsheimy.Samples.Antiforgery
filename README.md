# CSRF Attacks Samples

Those are some samples that show CSRF attacks and how to protect your apps from them using ASP.NET Core, JavaScript and Angular.

A full explanation is available on my blog here:
**Preventing Cross-Site Request Forgery using ASP.NET Core, JavaScript and Angular**

There are five projects in the repository:

 - The attack sample projects, AttackSample.AttackerApp and AttackSample.VulnerableApp which show a valid CSRF attack to a vulnerable app.
 - The secure sample projects, SecureSample.SecureApp and SecureSample.AttackerApp which show a failed CSRF attack to a protected app.
 - The Angular project, SecureSample.AngularApp, which stands at its own.
